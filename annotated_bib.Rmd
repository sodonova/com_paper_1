## Chronemics

One problem I'm running into is that there isn't very much
research on this. The research that is out there specifies
work/team communication or dating relationships; online dating
has many papers. 

What I want to study is more generally what the nonverbal cues
used in today's "CMC" or "IM" are. Chronemics is really
interesting, but I'm not sure if there's enough there for 5-7
pages. Some of the larger questions I'm interested in are:

- Can software developers mine data about quality
of conversation from simple timestamps?
- Do romantic partners have
different norms for speed of response?
- Is there some kind of
pacing effect based on word count of response? 
- How long does a
normal person take to respond to an email? a text? 
- Is there an
effect when technology nags you to respond?

**\fullcite{walther95}**

Useful for sure. Unfortunately doesn't establish much, but for 95 
it's pretty incredible. Mostly just that nighttime and 
daytime have different effects on communication, and that when
the message is responded to changes how both parties are viewed.

**\fullcite{doring09}**

Cites @walther95, I think it's cited by quite a few papers below as well. A
little hard to keep track of because it's inside a book. 

**\fullcite{tyler03}**

Cited by @kalman11 below, but doesn't cite Walther. Talks about the expectation
of a response by a certain time. Extremely small sample size and uses interviews.

**\fullcite{kalman11}**

Cites @walther95. About recruiting/job candidates.

**\fullcite{tu18}**

Cites @walther95 a couple times, similar stuff covered. About dating
relationships.

**\fullcite{kalman13}**

Really interesting!! Cites @walther95. About generalized chronemics and the
causal relationship between personality and pacing of conversations.


## Purdue Library wishlist

\fullcite{ling11} 

For @doring09 mostly. 

\fullcite{hinds02}

For @walther02. Can't read it so idk whether it's useful or not.
