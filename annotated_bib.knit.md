## Chronemics

One problem I'm running into is that there isn't very much
research on this. The research that is out there specifies
work/team communication or dating relationships; online dating
has many papers. 

What I want to study is more generally what the nonverbal cues
used in today's "CMC" or "IM" are. Chronemics is really
interesting, but I'm not sure if there's enough there for 5-7
pages. Some of the larger questions I'm interested in are:

- Can software developers mine data about quality
of conversation from simple timestamps?
- Do romantic partners have
different norms for speed of response?
- Is there some kind of
pacing effect based on word count of response? 
- How long does a
normal person take to respond to an email? a text? 
- Is there an
effect when technology nags you to respond?

**\fullcite{walther95}**

This is a landmark study from 1995 that establishes that chronemics matters in 
Computer Mediated Communication (CMC). Previously, it was assumed that CMC was
devoid of any nonverbal cues, the "cues-filtered-out" view. This was one of the first studies to notice that there are nonverbal, chronemic cues in CMC. It 
found that altering time and date stamps changed the way external observers
saw the communication. @walther95 validated two hypotheses and had complex results others. First, it proved (their H2) that a social message sent at night
signals less dominance than a social message sent during the day and that a task
message sent at night is more dominant than a task message sent during the day.
Second, it proved (their H3) that a slow reply to a social message indicates
greater affection than a fast reply, but a slow reply to a task message 
indicates less affection than a fast reply.

Cites @walther95, I think it's cited by quite a few papers below as well. A
little hard to keep track of because it's inside a book. 

**\fullcite{tyler03}**

Cited by @kalman11 below, but doesn't cite Walther. Talks about the expectation
of a response by a certain time. Extremely small sample size and uses interviews.

**\fullcite{kalman11}**

Cites @walther95. About recruiting/job candidates.

**\fullcite{tu18}**

Cites @walther95 a couple times, similar stuff covered. About dating
relationships.

**\fullcite{kalman13}**

Really interesting!! Cites @walther95. About generalized chronemics and the
causal relationship between personality and pacing of conversations.
