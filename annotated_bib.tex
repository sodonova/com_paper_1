\hypertarget{chronemics}{%
\subsection{Chronemics}\label{chronemics}}

One problem I'm running into is that there isn't very much research on
this. The research that is out there specifies work/team communication
or dating relationships; online dating has many papers.

What I want to study is more generally what the nonverbal cues used in
today's ``CMC'' or ``IM'' are. Chronemics is really interesting, but I'm
not sure if there's enough there for 5-7 pages. Some of the larger
questions I'm interested in are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can software developers mine data about quality of conversation from
  simple timestamps?
\item
  Do romantic partners have different norms for speed of response?
\item
  Is there some kind of pacing effect based on word count of response?
\item
  How long does a normal person take to respond to an email? a text?
\item
  Is there an effect when technology nags you to respond?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\fullcite{walther95}}

Useful for sure. Unfortunately doesn't establish much, but for 95 it's
pretty incredible. Mostly just that nighttime and daytime have different
effects on communication, and that when the message is responded to
changes how both parties are viewed.

\textbf{\fullcite{doring09}}

Cites \textcite{walther95}, I think it's cited by quite a few papers
below as well. A little hard to keep track of because it's inside a
book.

\textbf{\fullcite{tyler03}}

Cited by \textcite{kalman11} below, but doesn't cite Walther. Talks
about the expectation of a response by a certain time. Extremely small
sample size and uses interviews.

\textbf{\fullcite{kalman11}}

Cites \textcite{walther95}. About recruiting/job candidates.

\textbf{\fullcite{tu18}}

Cites \textcite{walther95} a couple times, similar stuff covered. About
dating relationships.

\textbf{\fullcite{kalman13}}

Really interesting!! Cites \textcite{walther95}. About generalized
chronemics and the causal relationship between personality and pacing of
conversations.

\subsection{Purdue Library wishlist}\label{purdue-library-wishlist}}

\fullcite{ling11}

For \textcite{doring09} mostly.

\fullcite{hinds02}

For \textcite{walther02}. Can't read it so idk whether it's useful or
not.
