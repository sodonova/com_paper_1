<h1 class="title">Chronemics in CMC</h1>
<h2 class="author">Sean F. O’Donovan</h2>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>When<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I communicate with others using computer mediated communication (instant messaging, sms, social networks, also known as cmc), I frequently notice that the conversation has a rhythm and pace. For example, responding quickly to messages says something different from responding slowly. Another example is that texting someone at 6 in the morning feels very different from texting them at midnight.</p>
<p>In interpersonal communication, this is called chronemics. The phenomenon I am choosing to investigate in this paper is chronemics in computer mediated communication. Given that people today are communicating with each other more than ever using social media and instant messaging, I think this topic is important to understand.</p>
<p>To define this cmc chronemics clearly, we must define chronemics. A study by <span class="citation">Walther and Tidwell (1995)</span> is a great place to start here. They quote Burgoon and Saine’s 1978 textbook to define chronemics as “how we perceive, structure, and react to time and … the messages we interpret from such usage” <span class="citation">(qtd. as cited in Walther and Tidwell 1995, 356)</span>. They go on to explain that “Temporal cues may be perceived by users, when they detect—with some systems, explicitly directed to detect—the arrival of a message, or the amount of time between one message and the next” <span class="citation">(Walther and Tidwell 1995, 356)</span>. In this case, we’re using the same definition. To summarize, chronemics in this paper means the frequency of communication, the pacing of the conversation itself (which is sometimes the same as the frequency of communication), and the time at which it takes place. This paper concerns cmc chronemics, so these attributes will be applied to computer mediated communication. My personal belief as I explore this topic is that chronemics communicate a lot in computer mediated communication, and to some extent take the place of nonverbal cues. Additionally, I think chronemics can be used to pull empirical data about relationships out of individual and aggregated conversations. This paper will begin by examining the way researchers have studied the existence of chronemics in cmc, and then discuss the ways researchers have been able to put chronemics to use. Researchers began to document the existence of chronemics in cmc in the 90s, and are still catching up to the pace of communication today.</p>
<h1 id="useful-theories">Useful Theories</h1>
<p>To start examining the literature on computer-mediated chronemics, we need to define and explain some general theories. The first and traditional theory is cues-filtered-out theory. This theory was introduced by <span class="citation">Sproull and Kiesler (1991)</span>, and is an extremely naive approach. It argues that cmc and cyberspace exist without any non-verbal cues, and therefore is a fundamentally different space. The main conclusion is that there will be fewer and less intense relationships in cyberspace. A side effect, according to the theory, is that relationships are less hierarchical and more democratic; everyone can have an equal share of the conversation. A good summary of the theory is that it views cmc as “inherently impersonal” <span class="citation">(Kim 2005, 16)</span>. The cues-filtered-out approach is the traditional approach that most other theories exist to disprove, and most people who have experienced cyberspace in any meaningful way would agree that this theory is seriously lacking.</p>
<p>The second theory to discuss is the social information processing (SIP) perspective. It claims that people are able to edit how they present themselves more, while people also give each other the benefit of the doubt more in cyberspace <span class="citation">(Kim 2005)</span>. This means that there is an opportunity for even more emotion and intensity of relationship than normal in cyberspace. It also claims that because people are missing normal cues, they fixate on what cues there are, such as writing style, written “nonverbals” like emojis, and other text cues like repeated letters <span class="citation">(Kim 2005)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="describing-cmc-chronemics-phenomena">Describing CMC Chronemics Phenomena</h1>
<p>The first and most important discovery by researchers about cmc chronemics was the acknowledgement that they exist and influence people’s impression of the conversation. This is the claim made by <span class="citation">Walther and Tidwell (1995)</span>, in contrast to the previous view that cmc is impersonal and doesn’t contain nonverbal cues. This was the first, most important paper which refuted cues-filtered-out theory. <span class="citation">Walther and Tidwell (1995)</span> was originally based on email communication, but it was also effectively replicated for sms by <span class="citation">Döring and Pöschl (2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The next important phenomenon documented by researchers is that of online silence. The idea that even in asynchronous communications, it is possible for silence to exist was documented by <span class="citation">Ravid, Raban, and Rafaeli (n.d.)</span> and also by <span class="citation">Y. M. Kalman and Rafaeli (2005)</span>. Kalman explains that “silence can be defined as no response after an x period of time, at which, say, 99% or 97% of the responses have already been created” (2005). <span class="citation">Y. M. Kalman and Rafaeli (2005)</span> also explains that the silence generated there can have major disruptive effects on online communication, from interfering with team collaboration, to creating misunderstandings.</p>
<p>This can be viewed through the lens of expectation violation theory as well, as described in <span class="citation">Yoram M. Kalman and Rafaeli (2011)</span> and <span class="citation">Sheldon, Thomas-Hunt, and Proell (2006)</span>. Surprisingly, they find different results; both concluded that the reward valence of the person violating chronemic norms changes how that violation is perceived, but <span class="citation">Sheldon, Thomas-Hunt, and Proell (2006)</span> found that low-reward violaters were more simply more negatively perceived that high-reward violaters. <span class="citation">Yoram M. Kalman and Rafaeli (2011)</span> found a more complex interaction, although both studies agreed that the norm violation was perceived negatively. Part of that is the context, as both the studies were centered around work. That lines up with Walther’s claims that task focused messages with high latencies were percieved negatively. These studies validate SIP theory by suggesting that chronemics are a form of nonverbal communication that participants tend to read into; cues filtered out theory would expect participants to ignore or discount the chronemics because the communication is happening in cyberspace.</p>
<h1 id="chronemics-applications">Chronemics Applications</h1>
<p>Part of the reason cmc chronemics are so interesting is that people build the systems that these interactions occur in; to me that means that if we can discover patterns in cmc chronemics that are well understood, people can apply those patterns when building cmc systems. For example, if a short response latency automatically meant that two communicators were closer to each other, that would be useful for measuring relationship strength and recommending future relational links in a social network. As far as I can tell, no such simple application exists. Instead, it seems that chronemics are being analyzed, but there isn’t all that much interest in it as a measurement. Part of this is because of contamination by other correlated variables, which will be discussed later. First, there are some promising uses of chronemics, starting with an apparent correlation with personality type discovered by <span class="citation">Yoram M. Kalman et al. (2013)</span>.</p>
<p>This study evaluates a measure called interpost pause. It builds on the findings of <span class="citation">Yoram M. Kalman and Rafaeli (2011)</span> and SIP theory by using chronemics as nonverbal cues that participants use in place of normal face to face cues. <span class="citation">Yoram M. Kalman et al. (2013)</span> found that people who were more extraverted “exhibited shorter interpost pauses,” and that pairs who trusted each other less had longer interpost pauses (p. 16). Interestingly, the correlation with trust was stronger than the correlation with extraversion. Unfortunately, it’s hard to know why these two results exist. For trust, <span class="citation">Yoram M. Kalman et al. (2013)</span> suggests it may come down to the assumption that lying is harder than telling the truth (and therefore should take longer), but it may also be that people just prefer their conversation partner to respond quickly and the dislike of slow responses bleeds into their trust for the person. For extraversion, <span class="citation">Yoram M. Kalman et al. (2013)</span> suggests this is mostly because extraverted people talk more and with less hesitation than intraverted people. Essentially, the same thing happens in face to face communication because that’s just the way people are. To me, this is incredible because it opens the possibility of studying those attributes with access to chat logs and without surveys which can be difficult to sample properly. For example, if Facebook wants to find out which of its users trust each other, it could conceivably make a computer model depending on interpost pause in messaging to find that out. Previously, they would have had to do a survey, then write a model comparing attributes in the survey to user attributes. Those attributes may not have yielded any correlation at all.</p>
<p>The idea that interpost pause or measurable chronemics of any kind could be very useful is something that for some reason, I couldn’t find many studies on. In particular, I was surprised I didn’t see studies using it to weight relationships and generate tie strength measurements. Facebook and other social medias generally recommend “friends” or other social links algorithmically, and in order to do that, they usually need measures of a user’s current relationships and their strengths. Link recommender systems for social media are incredibly important and profitable, and if you can generate better measures of relationships, you should get a better recommendation. First, we’ll discuss some cases where chonemics were able to improve tie strength prediction.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Arnaboldi, Guazzini, and Passarella (2013)</span> is a good example of this. In particular, they use many, many chronemic variables. The most effective were “number of days since last communication, the frequency of contact (bidirectional and related to incoming interactions) and the number of days since first communication” <span class="citation">(Arnaboldi, Guazzini, and Passarella 2013, 1137)</span>. Recency of communication was a great predictor of tie strength, validating the idea that tie strength should be predicted by chronemics. Unfortunately, most researchers (like <span class="citation">Servia-Rodríguez et al. (2014)</span>) only look at recency and duration of relationship. While this makes sense from a running time standpoint, it seems that interpost pause or time frame of most communication (like from <span class="citation">Walther and Tidwell (1995)</span>) could be useful.</p>
<p>Here we’ll discuss studies by <span class="citation">Marsden and Campbell (1984)</span> and <span class="citation">Liberatore and Quijano-Sanchez (2017)</span> that may provide an answer to why chronemics isn’t used more. Tie strength measurements in social networks (in general rather than the cmc specific meaning) have existed for a long time. One study which provides an example of that is <span class="citation">Marsden and Campbell (1984)</span>. It considers multiple variables for constructing tie strength in social networks. In particular, they consider measurements for duration and frequency of contact, in face to face interaction. The most important part of the study is that they find issues with using duration and frequency of contact, because there are so many confounding variables with those two measures. One example they discuss is neighbors - you may see your neighbor every day, and be dragged into an hour long conversation with them every day, and still dislike them or feel indifferent towards them. I think this type of confounding tends to make researchers apprehensive when they consider attempting studies like Kalman et al’s 2013 study. There are other explanations though.</p>
<p>One can be found in <span class="citation">Liberatore and Quijano-Sanchez (2017)</span>, in which a meta-study is conducted on the different ways to generate tie strength in cmc social networks. This is the measurement that I would expect to see chronemics factor into. The study does consider chronemics with one measure: Duration (of relationship). Unfortunately, many of the approaches don’t really consider chronemics outside of that factor. One of the reasons may be the difficulty of generating the data for every user; the studies which did include chronemics of individual pair conversations typically used a lot of variables, and still didn’t consider interpost pause. Unfortunately, the more variables used to generate tie strength, the worse the model can be to use, because the model can risk over fitting the data and being quite slow and expensive to use. In particular, if Facebook wants to generate tie strengths for their entire network, it will prefer models that are simpler because they take less computation time and are more reliable.</p>
<p>That said, it’s pretty odd to ignore nonverbal cues when researchers try to predict the strength of a relationship in cmc. When meeting a pair of people in real life, some of the first things anyone will look at to understand their relationship are the nonverbal cues in the conversation. Obviously in real life we can just ask, but Facebook won’t ask every user to rate every friend in their account.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To look ahead a bit, this research suggests that there is an opportunity to try and predict tie strength with interpost pause and aggregate time of messaging. There is also a possibility that this has been done already, but that the research isn’t published. In any event, cmc definitely has influential nonverbal cues in the form of chronemics.</p>
<p>Researchers have refuted theories that cmc doesn’t have chronemic nonverbal cues. They have documented their existence and influence on conversations, and have used them to some extent, although there is still much to be exploited in terms of their use.</p>
